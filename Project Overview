Patient Demographics Analysis (Excel Project)

This Excel project demonstrates how to analyze patient population data using formulas and Pivot Tables.
It focuses on deriving patient age, categorizing age groups, and visualizing key demographic insights across gender, ethnicity, and insurance status.

üè• Project Overview

The workbook provides a foundation for healthcare demographic analytics.
It simulates how clinical teams can segment patients and identify patterns that influence outcomes, insurance coverage, and resource distribution.

Key transformations include:

Deriving Age from Date of Birth using the DATEDIF() function.

Categorizing Age Groups (Child, Teen, Young Adult, Adult, Senior) using nested IF formulas.

Building Pivot Tables to analyze relationships between Gender, Ethnicity, and Insurance Status.

Formatting data for readability and professional presentation.

‚öôÔ∏è Features

Automated age calculation from Date of Birth

Dynamic age-group classification using conditional logic

Interactive Pivot Table dashboards summarizing patient demographics

Filters for gender, ethnicity, and insurance status to explore population trends

Reusable data structure suitable for public health or population management analytics
